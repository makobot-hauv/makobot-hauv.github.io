The housings have a female 8-pin bulkhead (Teledyne connector number MCBH-8-FS) and the cables between housings are male 8-pin inline connectors (Teledyne connector MCIL-8-MP) on 2 feet of Belden cable. IMPORTANT NOTE: These Belden cables are not actually rated for ethernet and do not contain twisted pairs. The cables are currently only 2 ft long and we have been observing adequate speeds (limited to 100BASE-T) over these cables, but this could be an issue in the future, especially if increased data speeds (e.g. gigabit) are needed. Cables would need to be replaced with a ProPlex PCCAT5EP or similar cable. Revisit this later if it become an issue. TODO: speed benchmarking across current Teledyne Ethernet cables Belden Cable Wiring The table below shows the mapping from bulkhead pin number to Belden cable wire color. Bulkhead Pin # Belden Cable Wire Color 1 black 2 white 3 red 4 green 5 blue 6 brown 7 yellow 8 orange Each pin number corresponds directly to the number on the punchdown connector (TODO add diagram). I.e., pin 8/orange wire will be wired to pin 8 on the punchdown. The bulkhead connectors use the same convention as the cables for wiring to the punchdown connectors. That is, pin 1/wire 1 on the bulkhead connector will wire to pin 1 on the punchdown connector, etc. Labels 1-8 on the internal white wires on the connectors correspond directly to the pin numbers on the outer bulkhead. Tether Ethernet Wiring The coloring on the tether pairs is different than on the Teledyne cable interconnects.
